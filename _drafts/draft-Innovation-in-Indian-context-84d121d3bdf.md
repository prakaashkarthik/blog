### Innovation in Indian context

One of the things I always think about (perhaps hypocritically so). As I read about unicorns and technological advancements, one of the questions I ask myself is if/how they can work in India, and what sort of opportunities are there in India. What can I do?

As I read Alec Ross’s “Industries of the Future” I kept asking myself those questions. One chapter that particularly had me piqued: “Geographies of the Future”.

I’d like to talk about that a little:

Key points:

* Openness of government, welcoming other cultures and people, less autocracy
* Opportunities for women
* Local domain expertise/requirements of local market
* Giving young people a chance
