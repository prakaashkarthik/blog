### We are what we eat — Part 2 — The Food, The Fad, and The Fromage

Multi-part series on my understanding of how our body treats food. ([Link to Part 0](https://medium.com/klein-bottle-shaped-rocks/we-are-what-we-eat-part-0-71c9be9cfa91))

#### Contents

* What the body needs
* The Food: What’s good for us
* The Fad: What may not be good for us
* The Fromage: Don’t say “Cheese”

#### The point

The point of this post is to talk about how the body treats the food that we eat, and help us make decisions, through reasoning, about what to eat and what to avoid.

#### But first…

If there’s one thing that pretty much everyone who has studied the human body agrees upon, it is that everyone’s body reacts a little differently to food. Research on gut bacteria is starting to reveal that our microbial residents may be to blame. That, and some genetic attributes as well. A reader may find that some of the things written below don’t apply to them, and that may well be the case. But it doesn’t make it false.

Anyway…

#### What the body needs

In the [last part](https://medium.com/klein-bottle-shaped-rocks/we-are-what-we-eat-part-1-on-exercise-6dcbf3d6180f), we spoke about energy systems and that there are certain vital foods that the body needs for every day activities — carbohydrates, fats, protein. But that was mainly for muscular functions and exercising.

What else does the body need?
