I can sleep when I’m dead” on many occasions. Often it was the first thing I’d be willing to compromise on in order to fit in more activities. College. Grad school. Work. It was sleep, after all. We can always catch up later. It was among the bottom of my priority list.</p><p name="18ac" id="18ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Shouldn’t have done that. I messed up. The crystal ball of hindsight now makes me wonder what could’ve been. Damn you, Dr. Matthew Walker.</p><p name="b286" id="b286" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Although I do have chapter-wise notes like I took for “<a href="https://medium.com/klein-bottle-shaped-rocks/notes-from-the-cheese-trap-b31101be0041" data-href="https://medium.com/klein-bottle-shaped-rocks/notes-from-the-cheese-trap-b31101be0041" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">The Cheese Trap</a>”, the notes for each chapter is about 500+ words. Plus, I don’t think I want to ruin the “what the f**k” and “holy shit” moments you’ll get from reading about the history, science, experiments, and results in the book. So I won’t be pasting those notes over here.</p><p name="926a" id="926a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, I do want to write about the content that really intrigued me, and highlight some things that are pertinent to me and to people that I know. The hope is that, with this understanding of sleep (aka mental models), we can make changes to our lifestyle to prioritize and get the most out of sleep.</p><p name="1ba7" id="1ba7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Do yourselves a favour, and read this book.

It achieves this by secreting melatonin at certain times of the day (after sunset).</p><p name="22b6" id="22b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sleep pressure is in the form of a hormone called Adenosine which binds with receptors in the brain (and is cleared out by the liver during sleep) which actually makes you sleep.</p><p name="f910" id="f910" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The circadian rhythm and sleep pressure work independent of each other. The circadian rhythm keeps chugging away at it’s normal frequency. Sleep pressure steadily rises over the course the day, and falls steeply over the period of our sleep. When the circadian rhythm’s sleep drive and the sleep pressure are both near their peaks is when we tend to/should fall asleep.</p><h4 name="7a1e" id="7a1e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">What caffeine does</h4><p name="4072" id="4072" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Interestingly, caffeine binds with the receptors in the brain that Adenosine is supposed to, and that’s why it helps keep you up. But there’s still built up Adenosine, which continues building up, so the more you push sleep away, the harder you’ll crash when you do sleep.</p><h4 name="e4e1" id="e4e1" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">As we fall asleep…</h4><p name="fcda" id="fcda" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing">The brain signals a slow down in heart rate, metabolism, and blood pressure. The core body temperature drops a little. These are essential to be able to sleep. The brain stem and Thalamus (our ‘sensory gate’) stop feeding sensory information to the other parts of the brain (not completely though).</p></div></div></section><section name="8ffd" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="dbdd" id="dbdd" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">During Sleep</h3><p name="8d3f" id="8d3f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">There are 3 phases of sleep that effectively “battle” for dominance in roughly 1.5 hour cycles. Light NREM (Stages 1 and 2 NREM). Deep NREM (Stages 3 and 4 NREM). REM.</p><p name="d526" id="d526" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">REM stands for Rapid Eye Movement (which is what happens to our eyes as we enter that phase of sleep). NREM is Non-REM.</p><p name="5fbf" id="5fbf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As the Thalamus blocks the sensory information, we fall into Light NREM sleep, and then afterwards slip into deep NREM. Our brainwaves during NREM are sinusoidal and predictable, with pulses starting in the middle of the frontal lobes and pulsing all the way to the back of the brain. Occasionally, there are “sleep spindles” that are observed during the downbeat in the NREM waves.</p><p name="8023" id="8023" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After deep NREM comes the chaos of REM. The Thalamus swings wide open, and our memories and emotions are played out in the theater of our brain — a phenomenon that we know as dreams. During REM, our body is actually paralyzed. This is why we don’t enact our dreams, even though during dreams the brain is throwing many motor instructions. The paralysis is signaled by a disabling signal that runs through the full length of the spinal cord from the brain stem.</p><p name="f4da" id="f4da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Importantly, as mentioned initially, the distribution of these 3 phases are not equal during their 90 minute cycles. NREM is more dominant in each cycle during the first 5–6 hours of sleep, and REM is more dominant in the last 2–3 hours. So by cutting off sleep in the morning, for example, 70% of your REM cycles could be lost and you’ll be the worse for it.</p><p name="1173" id="1173" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Note: we do actually dream in NREM as well, but the vivid, chaotic, hallucinogenic dreams that we experience are during REM.</p><h3 name="bc0b" id="bc0b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Can you catch up on sleep?</h3><p name="496a" id="496a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing">Not really. Although you may feel reasonably refreshed after compensating for lost sleep, the toll that sleep deprivation has taken on your body can’t be undone.</p></div></div></section><section name="e848" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="6715" id="6715" class="graf graf--h3 graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf--leading">“I’ll only sleep if it helps _________”</h3><p name="5984" id="5984" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Each stage of sleep provides some unique but necessary type of nourishment to our brain and our body.</p><p name="5f20" id="5f20" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s a list of all the things it helps with.

The frontal lobe, which is the decision making center of the brain, also understands what’s important and what isn’t — thereby strengthening memories that need to be and helping forget those that aren’t.</li><li name="5478" id="5478" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The memory transfer from hippocampus and cortex was enabled by the sleep spindles observed during NREM sleep; and for solidification of information learned, deep NREM sleep that happens earlier on in the night is more important than lighter NREM/REM that happens later on.</li><li name="97db" id="97db" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The sleep spindles seemed to be loops of current between the hippocampus and the cortex, indicating that the memory transfer was happening.</li><li name="c78f" id="c78f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">It was observed that in whomever more sleep spindles were observed, their learning was improved.</li><li name="5be2" id="5be2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Sleep spindles occurred during light NREM, but occurred more frequently in the later cycles of sleep sandwiched in between longer REM cycles. So ideally don’t cut short your sleep.</li><li name="1f2e" id="1f2e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Sleep spindles between the hippocampus and the frontal lobe are responsible for deciding what’s important and what isn’t. If you make a mental note to remember something, then chances are that during sleep that memory will be reinforced. Conversely if you make a mental note to forget something, chances are that it will be erased/diminished during sleep.</li></ul><p name="b091" id="b091" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Note:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="14b9" id="14b9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">If you lose out on sleep the very night after learning, your retention of what you learned diminishes. Catching up on the sleep later doesn’t help. So you *have* to sleep well the night after learning to retain it better.</li></ul><p name="23fd" id="23fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">So it would seem that a full night’s sleep is critical when it comes to learning and memorizing things.</p><h4 name="11a1" id="11a1" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Muscle Memory</h4><p name="2d67" id="2d67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The facts:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="cc82" id="cc82" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">When given a motor-oriented task that required practice, sleeping after practicing improved performance speed and quality.</li><li name="638e" id="638e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Example: typing, playing the piano, movements in sport etc.</li></ul><p name="1327" id="1327" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">How?</p><ul class="postList"><li name="0acf" id="0acf" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Instead of transferring the memories from hippocampus to cortex, the transfer happened to brain circuits near the motor cortex that operated at a slightly subconscious level — leading to development of what we call “muscle memory”.</li><li name="e3d9" id="e3d9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">It is once again the sleep spindles observed in Stage 2/Light NREM that seemed to loop through between the hippocampus to that area, and particularly sleep spindles that are observed during the last 2 hours of a full sleep that seem to enhance muscle memory.</li></ul><p name="ca8c" id="ca8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Do note that sleep augments the process, but you’ll still need to practice mad hours to excel at it.</p><h4 name="0d61" id="0d61" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Creativity, Problem Solving, Abstraction</h4><p name="024e" id="024e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">When we say creativity, it isn’t necessarily “artistic” in this context. It is also about problem solving abilities, the ability to obtain the gist of something you may have learned (abstract it away) so that you can apply the ideas to something completely different.</p><p name="c7b6" id="c7b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The facts:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="9c90" id="9c90" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Sleep improves connectivity between different ideas in the brain to amazing effect. This is enhanced if you think/obsess about a certain problem or idea before you sleep.</li><li name="4669" id="4669" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">One draws random, but valid, associations between objects after sleep, moreso than when they’re awake (where the associations are more logical).</li><li name="2914" id="2914" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Underlying patterns are also made more apparent after sleep (with sufficient REM cycles).</li><li name="b10f" id="b10f" class="graf graf--li graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--li">“Sleeping on it” is the right answer.</li></ul><p name="c1fb" id="c1fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">How?</p><ul class="postList"><li name="e302" id="e302" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Dreaming and REM sleep are where the magic happens.</li><li name="75e1" id="75e1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Not quite sure *how* the magic happens though. The studies that concluded the above weren’t as much about the brain chemistry than it was about associating the phases of sleep with our creative abilities.</li><li name="86e4" id="86e4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">When in REM, the visuospatial regions in the back of the brain, the motor cortex, hippocampus and surrounding memory regions, and amygdala and cingulate cortex (emotional centers) are 30% more active than when we are awake.</li><li name="257d" id="257d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">On top of that, the left and right sides of our prefrontal cortex, which manages our logical and rational thinking processes, are turned off. This could aid in the more fuzzy association between objects.</li><li name="2017" id="2017" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Anecdotal evidence that dreams help creativity: Mendeleev’s periodic table came to him in a dream; Benzene ring came to Kekule in a dream; “Let it be” came to Paul McCartney in a dream.</li></ul><p name="74e8" id="74e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Note:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="0f71" id="0f71" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">It’s easy to think that since memory regions are active during dreaming that dreams are a replay of our day. That is not the case. However, the emotions that we experienced during the day do get re-experienced during sleep.</li><li name="44ce" id="44ce" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">We also can dream about things that happened during the day (like a problem we’re trying to solve), and it is possible to control dreams (lucid dreaming).</li></ul><h4 name="a00a" id="a00a" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Get over trauma</h4><p name="8eea" id="8eea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The facts:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="2446" id="2446" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Sleep can act as therapy to help soothe memories of traumatic events (breakups, deaths, accidents etc). It can do this to greater effect if we dream about the traumatic event.</li></ul><p name="0ed2" id="0ed2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">How?</p><ul class="postList"><li name="806c" id="806c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">During sleep, the concentration of noradrenaline — a stress chemical in our brain associated with fight/flight responses — is low/zero. When traumatic memories are replayed in the brain, but in a relatively low-stress environment, the strong emotions associated with the events are stripped away. That is why this therapeutic effect is shown to be stronger for those who dream about the traumatic event.</li><li name="3c9e" id="3c9e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">What about PTSD? For PTSD sufferers, noradrenaline concentrations remain high in the brain. It was discovered that a drug originally meant to reduce blood pressure, when given to PTSD patients, cured them of their PTSD as well. This was because it reduced concentration of noradrenaline in the brain in the night as well.</li></ul><h4 name="63a3" id="63a3" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Concentration</h4><p name="00f9" id="00f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The facts:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="f921" id="f921" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">You need to sleep to keep up your concentration level at it’s optimum. Even a single night of sleep deprivation can result in drastically reduced concentration levels.</li><li name="6f27" id="6f27" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Sleeping 6 hours a night for 10 nights straight gives you the concentration level (on the 11th day) of someone who pulled an all-nighter . And this trend doesn’t plateau here. It just gets worse.</li><li name="762c" id="762c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Driving on just 4 hours of sleep is equal to driving at the point of being legally drunk.</li></ul><p name="a5d0" id="a5d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">How?</p><ul class="postList"><li name="4d70" id="4d70" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">The recycle rate of human beings is 16 hours.
