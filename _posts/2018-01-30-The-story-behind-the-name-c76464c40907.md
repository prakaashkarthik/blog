### The story behind the name

Before we get into the actual story, a bit of background:

The three authors who started this publication studied met during their undergrad. They did the same major, had similar extra-curricular interests, and loved Manchester United. So naturally we spent a lot of time together, and through our conversations realized we were going to be friends for a long time.

But what truly forged the bonds of our friendship was suffering through 4 summers in our college campus.

Our college campus, in the middle of nowhere in Tamil Nadu, India, had the knack of getting unscrupulously hot. In the summers, the heat would deprive us of the will to live. It was the events on one such summer day, on a walk back to hostel after a long schedule of classes, that led to the title of this publication.

Accurate portrayal of what life felt like back then

### The story

Anyone who knows Susa knows that back in college he never walked on his own two feet. He’d sling one arm over the shoulder of the person he was walking beside, and somehow transfer most of his weight on that hapless guy. On that fateful day, that guy was Prakaash.

There are no words to describe how tired Prakaash was that day, and the throbbing heat from the sun didn’t help one bit. Yet, as Susa rambled on about god-knows-what, Prakaash channeled every last ounce of energy he could summon to listen on and assimilate what Susa was saying, trying to bear the weight of Susa’s body and his words. For Susa is an honorable man.

Suddenly Susa stops mid-sentence, points to a rock on the ground, and says, “Hey, doesn’t that rock there look like a Klein bottle?”

That was the straw that broke the camel’s back, propelling Prakaash into a mental breakdown.

…

Somehow, Prakaash and Susa remained friends, and since then have shared more useful insights with each other and our third author, Pranav. This publication hopes to be a way to share those insights with everyone else.
