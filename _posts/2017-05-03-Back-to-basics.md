## Back to basics

For a while now, I’ve been introspecting to find the basis of this nagging unhappiness I’ve been experiencing. I realized that, quite simply, I miss being the younger me. At some point, that ambitious lad who thought everything was possible, who was a little more daring, a little more friendly, a more eloquent speaker, a more interesting writer, gave way to — well — me.

I realize that who I was back then was a result of my environment. I was fortunate enough to make great friends at school with whom I could both compete and collaborate. Not to mention the banter. The school I went to, for all the drawbacks of the education system, did give me a solid foundation. I knew how to play a few musical instruments. I also can’t neglect my undergrad experience either — my friends, the extra-curricular activities, hostel life, quizzing, competitions, organizing events.

But if I were to zero in on exactly why I was happier, I think it was simply because I knew more and I played more. My fundamentals were strong across different topics, different fields. And when I was mentally tired with all the academic learning, I had the perfect recharge in sports and other above-mentioned activities. Today, I work in a relatively niche area and on something that only a handful of people know about. As a result, my general fundamentals are waning due to lack of practice. And after an exhausting day at work, I come back home to eat, sleep, repeat, with the occasional gym session and Manchester United providing some respite from an otherwise monotonous lifestyle.

Getting back to the basics will help me extricate myself from this spiral. I can get my head up again, look at things differently, try different things with wisdom gained through age and experience. I hope to achieve this by establishing a routine, balancing life and work, revisiting basic science and math, playing some sport, and blogging. Basically, do what the younger me did, because I know for sure the younger me can achieve much more than the current me can.
