To dig into the platitudes, I’ve discovered more about myself: what I can achieve and what my vulnerabilities are. And I know that I’ve improved as a person this year, but I also know there’s a lot to still improve upon.</p><p name="72e6" id="72e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The hope is that, should I need a pick-me-up one day, I can read this retrospective and find some strength. Or if I need a reminder of the nature of complacency, this will serve as an antivenom. And perhaps there’s something a reader can gain from another man’s experiences?</p><h4 name="e34e" id="e34e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Mom</h4><p name="fab0" id="fab0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">January 2018: I went back home (to India) for a few weeks. As always, the end of the previous calendar year proved to be hectic work-wise, so I was looking forward to this trip. Spending some time with the folks and the sibling, celebrating a close friend’s wedding, meeting some old pals. A trip where I got some time to introspect, relax, and rejuvenate myself for the rest of the year.</p><p name="217d" id="217d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’d lost some weight since the last time I’d gone home (don’t remember how much), so I was looking forward to showing off my progress to my well-wishers — chief of whom is dear mother. At the start of 2015, I was 263 lbs (~120 kg), and just before this trip I’d weighed in at around 220 lbs (~100 kg). Before this I couldn’t do a proper push-up even on my knees (the shame). And now I could knock off 10 straight with ease, and could deadlift my body weight. So yeah, it was good progress and I was happy.</p><p name="6eb7" id="6eb7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just as I’d expected, my friends did express their surprise and provided their encouragement. “Hey, wow you have lost weight man. Well done! Next 6-pack for sure”. But my mom wasn’t quite as ecstatic. “Yes <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">kanna</em>. Well done, I’m proud of you”, she said halfheartedly.</p><p name="9a34" id="9a34" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I didn’t get it. My mom was the one who kept telling me what sort of exercises to do, for how long, what sort of food to eat, and all that good stuff that can get annoying after a point. And here I was, showing her the results. Sure, I didn’t lose the weight the way she told me to (I had my own gym routine), but the result was the same! Why couldn’t she be happy? Yes, I definitely had more weight to lose, and I was going to do it. But a little appreciation can be a great source of encouragement. So what gives?!</p><p name="2a73" id="2a73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And so, as it goes, there was a squabble. A squabble where, as it goes, there were to be no winners. I showed my mom all the tracking that I’d done for my weight loss, all the exercise, all the time I was spending doing other things and that’s why I couldn’t do the things she said, providing “valid” reasons for the “buts” my mom threw at me. Voices gradually rising along with tempers. And just as she was about to walk out of the room, my mom said, “Prakaash, you don’t really want to lose weight. You’re only trying to convince yourself that you do”</p><h4 name="6174" id="6174" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Really Wanting Something</h4><p name="b5cc" id="b5cc" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h4">“What on Earth do you mean by that, ma!? How could I have lost this much weight if I didn’t want it!?”, I retaliated.</p><p name="34aa" id="34aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She said, “I’ve seen you when you really want something to get done. If you want to watch a Man United match, go out with your friends, or if you’re studying for a test, or whatever it is.</p><blockquote name="c894" id="c894" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Nothing else in your life matters at that point, and everything in your life revolves around it</blockquote><p name="b869" id="b869" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--blockquote">“So that’s why I’m saying you don’t really want this. You’re still eating pizza, pasta, chocolate; drinking alcohol”, she says with a shrug and walks out.</p><p name="017d" id="017d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s when it really hit me. She was absolutely right. I wanted to lose weight, to look and feel good, but I wasn’t behaving like I really did.</p><h4 name="b5ff" id="b5ff" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Ascent</h4><p name="914f" id="914f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I came back to the US knowing what I had to do. My priority for this year was my physical and mental health. I set goals that I wanted to achieve by the end of the year, and I wanted to adopt a set of habits that were adaptable (that weren’t dependent on time or location), and sustainable (lifestyle changes, not just temporary measures).</p><p name="ca46" id="ca46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Fitness targets</strong>: I wrote down exactly how much I wanted to weigh, what my waist size should be, what my body fat % should be by the end of the year. Next was to decide how I needed to go about it.</p><p name="f71d" id="f71d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What really got me going though was making some dietary changes. I needed to resolve some issues that seemed to be of gastrointestinal origin, and so I visited the doctor who told me to start isolating food groups to see which one reduced my symptoms. As I stopped having some foods (bread, milk, cheese, lots of rice), I noticed that not only did the symptoms go away, I also started losing weight at a faster rate than before!</p><p name="a4b7" id="a4b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I found the need to understand my body more, and so I read some books — lessons from which I’ve penned down in my previous posts. I stopped having bread, milk, cheese altogether, started halving my dinner portions, and made sure I finished it early enough (before 7pm). This, combined with my regular gym routine, meant my weighing machine was a little more grateful every week.</p><p name="3bf4" id="3bf4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’d found a fitness system and a diet that worked for me, even over small breaks and on vacations. “What about cheat days?”, you ask? No, not this time. I really wanted to get fit — and stay fit. This was a lifestyle change.</p><p name="17a0" id="17a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Mental health</strong>: This one was a little more difficult to get a grip on. I was constantly frustrated because there were so many things that I “wanted” to do. Sometimes I’d act on them, but with no real consistency and no depth. The first thing I needed to (re)learn was how to finish things I start.</p><p name="8827" id="8827" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I started by setting myself small, achievable goals. My starting point was this inspirational post on “<a href="https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/standard-of-performance/" data-href="https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/standard-of-performance/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Standard of Performance</a>” that a good friend shared with me. I needed to improve mine drastically, and I started by setting goals that I’m ashamed to even call “goals”: make my bed after I wake up; wash my utensils as soon as I was done eating; put my clothes in the appropriate place when I removed them. I also adopted the principle that if something takes less than 2 minutes to do, just finish it.</p><p name="49c0" id="49c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then there were the habit-building goals: write down what you want to achieve tomorrow before you go to sleep today; get up in a certain time window; read a few pages of a book; summarize the chapter you’ve just read; meditate for 5–10 minutes; eat dinner before 7pm.</p><p name="9456" id="9456" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And then finishing goals: start writing blog posts and actually publish them; lose 1–2 lbs over the course of the week; finish this book by this point in time so you can start the next; make sure you finish your list of goals before you sleep.</p><p name="9975" id="9975" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I made sure that I wasn’t stressing myself by assigning too many goals. I started by giving myself a minimal number of goals first and then increased the number when I needed to challenge myself.</p><p name="d95c" id="d95c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As I went through this process, I realized a couple of things:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="fd0e" id="fd0e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Calling something complete and finishing things made me happy</li><li name="45be" id="45be" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">But <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">creating</em> something new left me satisfied</li></ol><p name="f6de" id="f6de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">For example, although I was proud that I tallied up a 70-day meditation streak, I wasn’t as satisfied as when I finally published a blog post, or wrote a script that helped someone at work.</p><h4 name="f53b" id="f53b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Peak…</h4><p name="f08b" id="f08b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">As I entered Summer 2018, I was on a high. I had systems in place and they were working wonders for me. Around July I was 195 lbs, down ~25 lbs from the start of the year. I was physically fitter and mentally stronger than I’ve ever been before. I finished things I started and was no longer a slave to instant gratification. I had clarity of thought, and started to understand myself better. The systems that I had in place were working and I was on top of the world.</p><h4 name="6d5b" id="6d5b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">… and the Slip</h4><p name="62e7" id="62e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">And that’s when complacency crept it.</p><p name="51ad" id="51ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I missed a day of meditation. So what? I had a 70+ day streak, so I know I can pick up the habit again. I didn’t fold the clothes as soon as they came out of the laundry. So what? I’ve done it consistently in the past, and I will in the future. I indulged myself with a some chocolate cake. So what? I’ve kept myself in check for the last 6 months. I’ll keep myself in check going forward.</p><p name="2a5d" id="2a5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A string of trips meant my routine was destabilized. Damn it, I tested this routine with a few short trips before, and I snapped back into it just fine. What the hell happened now? I guess my systems weren’t as resilient as I thought.</p><p name="7c94" id="7c94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My weight loss plateaued, hovering in the low 190s, and although I never wavered too much from the dietary restrictions I’d imposed on myself, my little indulgences here and there meant I wasn’t going to make significant further progress.</p><p name="945c" id="945c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But at least I wasn’t packing on the pounds again. If I squinted, I could even say I was still making progress — just at a slower rate.</p><p name="c83e" id="c83e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My mental health progress suffered the most. I couldn’t string together a week of continuous meditation. My Standard of Performance was on the fun part of the roller coaster ride. My habit of listing goals for the next day went from consistent to sporadic, and my completion rate was no longer 100%. I was still reading books and starting blog posts, but I was no longer finishing. My sense of satisfaction was being replaced by a familiar feeling of frustration.</p><p name="afcc" id="afcc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Slip started somewhere around August-September, and I still haven’t recovered from it completely. I did lose more weight (albeit aided by a viral throat infection and a consequent realization that perhaps restricting my eating some more will help) that brought my annual tally to ~40 lbs. But somewhere along the way, I stopped <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">really</em> wanting to achieve more. The voice that told me to keep improving was drowned by the clangor of complacency. My clarity of thought was once again fogged by confusion.</p><h4 name="dfc5" id="dfc5" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Introspection and Recovery</h4><p name="db23" id="db23" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">What caused the Slip? Was it systemic? Was it just a lack of grit? How do I build a system that isn’t overly reliant on willpower? What do I need to do to get back to where I was, and then climb further?</p><p name="e321" id="e321" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My first step now is to get back to the basics. Build out my habits again — this time I know there’s a process that works. Along the way, I must figure out what I need to keep it going. Slips are part of the journey, but I must not tolerate it like I did in the second half of this year. Understand the cause, fix it, and keep going. If a system is broken, update it immediately.</p><p name="af6e" id="af6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I need to become more ruthless about the obstacles to my goals. Just like how giving up certain foods that “I couldn’t live without” became a lifestyle, sticking to the basic principles and keeping up my Standard of Performance should be a matter of lifestyle. Something I center my actions around.</p><p name="827b" id="827b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The path forward for me is clear. It’s time to move onward and upward. Let’s see how 2019 goes.</p></div></div></section>
