He also walks us a little through the Dairy lobbying that happens in the US and what the cows go through. Towards the end he talks about what a preferable diet would consist of, and there are recipes as well towards the end.</p><p name="9690" id="9690" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ll be honest with you guys, this book was a tough read for me. For the past 20+ years cheese was the most consistent part of my diet. I’d quaff down more than my fair share of pizza once a week; I loved me some eggplant parm; Calzones, fries with cheese, nachos with cheese, burritos with cheese, pasta made with creamy Alfredo sauce. Hmm.</p><p name="8816" id="8816" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But once I’d digested what I read, it wasn’t hard for me to decide and follow through on giving up most forms of dairy. And I’m all the better for it.</p><p name="fddb" id="fddb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Please do give the author his due and buy the book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GQIY9EM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GQIY9EM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“The Cheese Trap”</a> . He provides more insight into the research behind the assertions in his book and anecdotes in it. There are also some great recipes at the end of it, which also involves usage of nutritional yeast as a substitute for cheese in terms of texture.</p><figure name="60b2" id="60b2" class="graf graf--figure graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ud8ZCnesV0qPMxgH4qlPVw.jpeg" data-width="331" data-height="500" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ud8ZCnesV0qPMxgH4qlPVw.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GQIY9EM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GQIY9EM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“The Cheese Trap”</a></figcaption></figure><p name="7091" id="7091" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">My own personal anecdote (and yes, this could very well be correlation without causation): having given up on cheese and dairy for the most part, my exercise routines have been a lot more effective and I’ve lost weight quicker.</p><p name="3f3b" id="3f3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Without further ado:</p><h4 name="c8af" id="c8af" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Chapter 1: The Ultimate Processed Food</h4><p name="505c" id="505c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This chapter talks about how cheese is actually made. Cheese is a concentrated form of milk — hence a concentrated form of it’s fat, protein, calories, calcium, hormones etc. Essentially you take a lot of milk, pour them into vats (where you homogenize their content, and add colour in case it isn’t already coloured by existing beta-carotene in milk), add bacteria for flavour (the family of bacteria depends on what cheese you want — and most of them are responsible for some natural human body odour), then add enzymes to coagulate it (enzyme called rennet is added, makes the fluid into curd + whey). Once you have the cheese, add a ton of salt to prevent bacteria from growing more, and form it into the shape you want.</p><p name="c792" id="c792" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So what’s in Cheese that makes it so bad:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="b01c" id="b01c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">It concentrates calories. A cup of milk has 149 calories; a cup of melted Cheddar has 986 calories</li><li name="7deb" id="7deb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">It concentrates dairy proteins, such as Casein. Casein can trigger some respiratory problems, arthritis, skin issues etc.</li><li name="bedb" id="bedb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">It concentrates cholesterol and saturated fat — which leads to heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s</li><li name="d8c8" id="d8c8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">It has a lot of Sodium/salt which can contribute to high blood pressue</li><li name="1dd5" id="1dd5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Also contains a variety of chemicals, opiates, hormones — which are detrimental to the body</li></ul><p name="2d4d" id="2d4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">In the US, cheese consumption when up from 4lbs a year per person in 1909 to 33.4lbs a year in 2013.</p><h4 name="3af9" id="3af9" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Chapter 2: More Calories than Coke, More Salt than Potato Chips: What Cheese does to your waistline</h4><p name="dc69" id="dc69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">A research study in NZ showed that people eating cheese tended to gain about a pound a month. To put that into perspective, the average for an American is 1.5lbs a *year*. So without question, adding cheese to one’s diet definitely resulted in weight gain.</p><p name="3b35" id="3b35" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Where does this weight gain come from?</p><ul class="postList"><li name="7254" id="7254" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Added calories from fat. Fats, when ingested, undergo very little change in structure before being packed into fat cells. In contrast, sugars and carbohydrates (which typically get used up by muscles for energy) if eaten in excess of whatever can be converted to glycogen can get converted into fat by an energy consuming process. So fats = added calories.</li><li name="dedf" id="dedf" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Slowed metabolism due to fat. This is because fat deposits into muscle cells, and this inhibits mitochondria production. Mitochondria are the ones that burn the calories to produce energy. So by inhibiting mitochondrial production, we’re lowering out ability to burn the extra calories we put on. Researchers found that a high-fat diet can inhibit the mitochondria-producing genes within 3–4 days — and saturated fats do this more effectively than unsaturated fats.</li><li name="ce9a" id="ce9a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The reason for this can be traced back to our hunter-gatherer origins, where we needed to store fat to be used later. So our body evolved to slow down mitochondria production in the presence of fat.</li><li name="535e" id="535e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Sodium retains water (therefore adding water weight). In general if we throw out salty foods, we can see the difference on the weighing scale.</li></ul><p name="7f68" id="7f68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Cheese conspicuously doesn’t have fiber — which helps absorb extra hormones running amok in the body, and helps us feel full (thereby helping us control our food intake). Book doesn’t mention it, but fiber also nourishes our gut bacteria.</p><p name="d5eb" id="d5eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The gut bacteria also have weird reactions to fatty foods. They not only help extract more calories from the food, but also help the fat get into the bloodstream. That can lead to heart disease and the like.</p><p name="4fe7" id="4fe7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Atkins’ diet (which is low carb-high fat) has been proven to be bad as it increases dieter’s cholesterol to ridiculous levels. They lose weight only because of the calories-in-calories-out metric.</p><h4 name="c763" id="c763" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Chapter 3: How Cheese Keeps You Hooked</h4><p name="487a" id="487a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Three reasons: Salt, Grease, and Opiates</p><p name="5854" id="5854" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Salt: Our brain cells release dopamine when we eat salty foods, as a positive feedback to ensure we eat salty foods. This is a vestige of our hunter-gatherer biology again — our tongue is sensitive to salt, our brain rewards salt intake — because salt was very hard to come by then, and in small amounts is healthy for our body. Cheese has a lot of salt in it, so anything with cheese automatically triggers a “this is good for you, eat more” signal.</p><p name="f2c1" id="f2c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Opiates: Casomorphins. When the casein protein is broken down into it’s amino acids, the process also releases structures called casomorphins, which are morphine-like compounds that attach to the same brain receptors that narcotics do. So there are opiates built right into cheese that keep you coming back for more.</p><p name="07ba" id="07ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A question is raised about whether molecules as big as casomorphins can actually enter the bloodstream and into the brain. There were studies done that first proved that casomorphins can enter the bloodstream from the GI tract, and then there was some evidence that these casomorphins could even get past the brain-blood barrier.</p><p name="dd75" id="dd75" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then there are some mentions about how you find out if you’re actually addicted to cheese by marking yourself against generic addiction metrics (take in larger amounts than intended, persistent desire/unsuccessful attempts to cut down or control use/continued use despite problems associated with the substance). I actually found that when I was eating cheese, I did actually check all these boxes. I was addicted!</p><h4 name="06cb" id="06cb" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Chapter 4: Hidden Hormone Effects</h4><p name="66a1" id="66a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Hormones are meant to perform specific functions in the body — like Insulin, Epinephrine (or Adrenaline). They affect the flow of things in the body (like reducing blood sugar level, or raising it, widening pupils, increasing blood pressure etc.). Hormones are generated and regulated by the body. Adding to it by consuming extra hormones from elsewhere can result in hormonal imbalance — which in turn results in a large number of diseases (cancer, heart attacks, blood clots etc)</p><p name="5ac5" id="5ac5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dairy (milk) is produced by animals that have been pregnant and need to provide nourishment for their young. During pregnancy, it’s been observed that estrogen levels in the milk spike like mad. This estrogen finds its way into dairy products that we consume. Question is — are these levels enough to harm us? Answer seems to be yes. In men, for example, on average the sperm count was 28% less in those who consumed cheese. In women, it increased the risk of cancer.</p><p name="47dc" id="47dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Aside from that, body fat generates estrogen. And since we gain body fat with cheese/dairy, this can have compound effects.</p><p name="d3af" id="d3af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These extra hormones are also sent to the Liver, which filters the blood and removes toxins/extra hormones. These are then flushed through the bile duct to the GI tract. I’m not entirely sure what happens to them from here, *but* if you eat fiber, the fiber soaks up the extra hormones and they find their way outside the body. So eating fiber can help keep your hormones in check.</p><p name="d10d" id="d10d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Studies have also linked dairy with increased risk of developing prostate cancer. Reason being milk stimulates production of something called “insulin-like growth factor” aka IGF-I. Some test tube experiments have shown that IGF-I helps cancer cells grow.</p><p name="ceb7" id="ceb7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s also Vitamin D. Vitamin D helps the body absorb more Calcium. It also is known for protecting our body from Cancer. So when you drink a lot of milk, there’s a lot of Calcium flowing in the body, and hence the need for Vitamin D activation slows down. Less Vitamin D means increased risk of Cancer</p><h4 name="6225" id="6225" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Chapter 5: Health problems you never bargained for</h4><p name="cc7a" id="cc7a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Chapter starts off with explaining how dairy tends to make reactions to allergies worse. The specific example is asthma attacks, and an anecdote shows how someone quit cheese/dairy and his asthma that he was carrying since he was a kid went away. Not much in terms of science here — just association.</p><p name="41e8" id="41e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There has been research that shows that having dairy/fat can make it harder for oxygen to pass from the lungs into the bloodstream. Researchers speculate that there are certain compounds that interfere with the oxygenation in the lungs are produced when dairy is consumed.</p><p name="9b32" id="9b32" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some other things that seem to have correlation with dairy consumption: arthritis, tendonitis, migraines, healthy skin, better digestion, type 1 diabetes. I say correlation because a lot of these studies were experiments where they basically either gave or avoided giving dairy products to people, and the results were staggeringly in favour of avoiding these products altogether.</p><p name="7824" id="7824" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For type 1 diabetes — apparently there’s role played by dairy in preventing the pancreas from producing insulin</p><h4 name="9206" id="9206" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Chapter 6: Heart Disease, Diabetes, and the French Paradox</h4><p name="32d6" id="32d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This chapter talks about the most obvious risks of eating cheese: how it results in heart disease, diabetes. The French Paradox is basically about how although the french love their wine + cheese, they don’t seem to die of heart attacks — but the stats are bunkum.</p><p name="4cc2" id="4cc2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Diabetes basically means that there’s too much glucose in the bloodstream, and the muscle cells and liver don’t respond to the insulin — hence don’t use this blood sugar. Research has shown that the main culprit is fat building inside the muscle and liver cells. And saturated fat is worse than unsaturated fat in this regard. Studies have shown that saturated fat can reduce insulin sensitivity within hours of consumption. We also know by now that cheese has lots of fat.</p><p name="a0d0" id="a0d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Reversing diabetes brought on by eating a lot of fatty food can be reversed with exercise and a diet that avoid animal products entirely. This brings down the fat and cholesterol.</p><p name="0508" id="0508" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Similar story with heart disease. Moderate exercise and a vegetarian diet meant that the arteries cleared up by 82%.</p><p name="4017" id="4017" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Essentially, heart disease is when cholesterol builds up in the arteries and forms plaques along the wall. Sometimes these plaques can burst, triggering formation of a clot which can stop blood flow to the heart. This results in part of the heart muscle dying (called myocardial infarction aka heart attack). Much of this cholesterol comes from animal products.</p><p name="16b7" id="16b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cholesterol is required for making hormones, bile acid, and maintaining cell flexibility. The body generally makes all the cholesterol we need (doesn’t explain how though).</p><p name="b241" id="b241" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fatty foods also make blood thicker, which means more blood pressure required to pump it through the body.</p><p name="8947" id="8947" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Saturated fat is also implicated in Alzheimer’s.</p><h4 name="1f49" id="1f49" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Chapter 7: What the Animals Go Through</h4><p name="91ba" id="91ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Cows are kept in tight areas, de-horned in a painful way so that they don’t damage each other.</p><p name="06f9" id="06f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since only pregnant cows give milk, cows are artificially inseminated, give birth to calves. Calves are almost immediately taken away — and the pain of separation is ridiculous in animals. You can see cows running after their calves, basically crying for them.</p><p name="8f12" id="8f12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cows that are done milking and cannot breed anymore are sent for slaughter. Calves take up this cycle as well.</p><p name="c858" id="c858" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are also significant environmental factors as well:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="9e22" id="9e22" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Cows need a massive amount of water to drink. They also need a lot of feed grain. Millions of acres are devoted to these crops (like corn, soybeans) which are grown to feed animals. These crops need to be irrigated as well — so there’s a huge requirement for water that goes into rearing cows.</li><li name="0851" id="0851" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Pollution: fertilizer for the crop that runs off into the water bodies, causing eutrophication/algal blooms.</li><li name="947d" id="947d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Climate change: Cows produce a *LOT* of methane, which is a greenhouse gas.</li></ul><h4 name="c6a7" id="c6a7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Chapter 8: The Industry Behind The Addiction</h4><p name="8455" id="8455" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This chapter talks about everything the industry does to keep the population hooked onto Cheese. It’s grotesque, to be honest.</p><p name="4245" id="4245" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dairy Management Inc. is a body that governs production and sale of dairy in US. They held a “Cheese Forum” to discuss how to sell more cheese. They came up with the concept of “triggering” the cheese craving in Americans. Customers can be divided into 2 types — “Enhancers” who add a little cheese to their food for taste, and “Cravers” who love cheese and will double/triple cheese intake with very little prodding. The idea was to target the cravers.</p><p name="01fa" id="01fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The way they did that was by targeting fast-food chains and having them put cheese on everything. They did deals with Wendy’s, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, Burger King, and worked with them to model their menus to include more cheese.</p><p name="1e52" id="1e52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They also started bending the truth a little in their advertisting to make it seem like cheese would actually benefit you. Example — some study said that the calcium in cheese would help burn fat *in a reduced calorie diet* — which promptly became a “eat cheese, lose weight” advertising campaign. This study was in fact paid for by the National Dairy Council. And apparently the guy doing the study had a weight-loss book deal. So money was involved.</p><p name="cce6" id="cce6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Calcium reasoning was also disproved by Harvard studies that showed that women who took no Calcium supplements but had milk everyday isntead actually suffered more fractures than those who took Calcium supplements. That being said, Calcium is required — just not in the large amounts that is available in dairy/cheese.</p><p name="c697" id="c697" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course they also have gag orders and the like that prevent people from revealing the truth about dairy/cheese. Whistleblowers on the dairy/agriculture industry have been punished previously for exposes. Example Amy Meyer in 2013 — took a video of a sick or injured cow being taken away in a tractor like garbage. The slaughter company tried to hush up what was happening and had Amy Meyer prosecuted.</p><h4 name="6110" id="6110" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Chapter 9: A Healthy Diet</h4><p name="9427" id="9427" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This chapter talks about what constitutes a healthy diet.</p><p name="da44" id="da44" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What’s In:</strong> things that should be on your plate in a meal: Vegetables, Legumes, Whole grains, Fruit.</p><p name="68b8" id="68b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Vegetables — have vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and no “bad fat” or cholesterol. Brocolli, Kale, Brussel sprouts, Spinach etc. Orange vegetables — like sweet potato, carrot are also good.</p><p name="4d12" id="4d12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Legumes: Beans, peas, lentils, chickpeas foods that grow in a pod. They are rich in protein, calcium, iron, fiber. Hummus, Tofu, Soy Milk also count since they’re derivatives of legumes.</p><p name="607b" id="607b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Whole grains: rice, corn, wheat — ideally brown rice. Grains provide protein, fiber, complex carbs.</p><p name="148c" id="148c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fruits: Blueberries, papayas, mangoes, apples, oranges, bananas, pears etc. All vitamin rich and provide glucose/sucrose.</p><p name="59b7" id="59b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What’s out:</strong> Dairy products, Eggs, Meat/Poultry/Fish, Added oils, Sugary/Processed foods</p><p name="f4e5" id="f4e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dairy: Fatty, have weird proteins, hormones. Avoid cheese, whole milk, full-fat yoghurt, butter. Skim/Fat-free have those weird proteins.</p><p name="2284" id="2284" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Eggs: lots of cholesterol in the yolk, lots of animal protein in the egg-white. No fiber, no complex carbs. Don’t need it, basically.</p><p name="9b6b" id="9b6b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Meat/poultry/fish: Fatty</p><p name="cbd4" id="cbd4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Added oils: this one surprised me a little, because it did ask me to avoid olive oil as well, even though it was a little better than other oils. Essentially olive oil is better because it has *less* saturated fat. But is there really a reason to add saturated fat in the diet at all? Any required fat content is avaialble in plant-based foods — eg: nuts, seeds, olives, avocados.</p><p name="bf0d" id="bf0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sugary/processed foods: causes increase in blood glucose, which could cause reduced insulin sensitivity. Not exactly terrible, but not great either. Avoid when you can.</p><p name="cef7" id="cef7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Supplements: Take Vitamin B12 — because the body doesn’t naturally make it. It is made by bacteria. And Vitamin D — but in moderate doses. Vitamin D helps absorb calcium and protects you from Cancer.</p></div></div></section>
