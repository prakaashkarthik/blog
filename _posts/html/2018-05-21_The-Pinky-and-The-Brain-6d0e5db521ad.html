I wanted to start off with <a href="https://medium.com/klein-bottle-shaped-rocks/we-are-what-we-eat-part-1-on-exercise-6dcbf3d6180f" data-href="https://medium.com/klein-bottle-shaped-rocks/we-are-what-we-eat-part-1-on-exercise-6dcbf3d6180f" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">the muscular system</a>, then <a href="https://medium.com/klein-bottle-shaped-rocks/notes-from-the-cheese-trap-b31101be0041" data-href="https://medium.com/klein-bottle-shaped-rocks/notes-from-the-cheese-trap-b31101be0041" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">the digestive system</a>, and end with psychology and the brain. So while I was always interested in learning about how we made decisions (spurred by my reading of “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002C949KE/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002C949KE/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Predictably Irrational</a>”), since reading “<a href="https://medium.com/klein-bottle-shaped-rocks/takeaways-from-why-we-sleep-d680d44ba07a" data-href="https://medium.com/klein-bottle-shaped-rocks/takeaways-from-why-we-sleep-d680d44ba07a" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">Why We Sleep</a>” my curiosity has veered more towards the actual functioning of the brain.</p><p name="a0d5" id="a0d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To satisfy my knowledge here, I went on a Kindle book buying spree and lapped up a few based on reviews. Rather unfortunately I don’t think I will be reading them in the near future — for I have been rendered awestruck by what I’m reading in “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Phantoms-Brain-Probing-Mysteries-Human/dp/0688172172" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Phantoms-Brain-Probing-Mysteries-Human/dp/0688172172" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Phantoms in the Brain</a>” by Dr. V.S. Ramachandran.</p><figure name="e3f0" id="e3f0" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Tr75EJDjPk9bZ4hIdrEepA.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Tr75EJDjPk9bZ4hIdrEepA.jpeg"></figure><p name="bcfc" id="bcfc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Dr. Ramachandran’s specialty is in phantom limbs. This is when amputees, or in some cases people who have been born without certain limbs, actually experience vivid sensations in their absent limbs. They can feel their phantom hand grab for a cup, they can feel their phantom arm wave good-bye, but the problem arises when they feel extreme pain — for how can you kill pain in a limb that isn’t there?</p><p name="3ea0" id="3ea0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m only 3 chapters in, and so far Dr. Ramachandran:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="274a" id="274a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Provides us a preliminary description of the brain and its parts, and an interesting anecdote about a woman who was normal, except her right hand kept trying to strangle her to death only to be thwarted by her left hand. Using that anecdote he described communication between the two halves of the brain and how they can be out-of-sync.</li><li name="3642" id="3642" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Introduces us to the Penfield Homunculus, which is a description of which exact physical locations in the brain receive sensory information from all the parts of the body (head to toe)</li><li name="c4ce" id="c4ce" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Describes the original research that led him to test his theories on phantom limbs…</li><li name="d801" id="d801" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">… and continues to take us along with him as he recounts his patients, their phantom sensations, the experiments he and his team performed, and the consequent findings</li></ul><h3 name="53e0" id="53e0" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">What I’ve learned</h3><ul class="postList"><li name="28ee" id="28ee" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h3">There is a “map” in the brain where different locations correspond to the sensory perception of different parts of the human body. For example, with this map, you can find out which small area in the brain will activate when something touches your hands.</li><li name="6bc7" id="6bc7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">This map (called the Penfield Homunculus) located at the top of our head, in the Parietal lobe. In it, the areas for our genitals and our feet are close to each other. The area associated with the trunk of our body is actually small, but the areas associated with our face, hands, lips are pretty big — owing to the degree of complexity in sensation perceived by each part.</li><li name="79d9" id="79d9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">When a limb is amputated, there is a slight remapping that seems to occur. The result of this remapping is that when you stimulate a part of the body which is mapped close to the amputated limb, the person feels something in the limb that isn’t there. For example, the arm and the mouth are mapped close to each other, so when someone touches the face (in certain locations) of an arm amputee, they feel that touch in the face *and* the amputated arm. Another example, since the genitals and the feet are mapped next to each other, the climax of sexual intercourse resulted in a leg amputee feeling intense orgasm in his leg as well!</li><li name="4464" id="4464" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Neurologists Lord Russell Brain and Henry Head (you couldn’t make this up) coined the term “Body image”. This is an image of our body maintained by the Parietal lobe based on the information it receives from the muscles, joints, eyes, motor command center. This body image is also updated based on this.</li><li name="c37f" id="c37f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Instructions for movement are given by our motor cortex which is present in our Frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex is associated with simple movements, like wiggling a finger, whereas the supplementary motor area (present immediately in front of it) is in charge of more complex movements.</li><li name="cb32" id="cb32" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">This area gives specific instructions to the motor cortex, and these instructions travel from there, through the spinal cord, to the opposite side of the body where the instructions are carried out. But these instructions are also sent to the cerebellum and the Parietal lobe, two processing areas, informing them of the action to be taken. Once the action is executed, the muscles and joints send back signals to these two areas indicating the action has been performed. Visual confirmation is also one of those feedback signals. These update the body image in the Parietal lobe.</li><li name="9f23" id="9f23" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Hijacking this visual feedback by using a box with a mirror allowed patients who suffered phantom limb paralysis to feel like they could move their phantom limb again. For example, someone with an amputated arm would put their good arm in one side of the box (separated by a mirror) and their phantom in the other side. The reflection of the good arm in the mirror would look like the amputated arm. Once their brain gave instructions to move both arms, visual feedback from the mirror indicating that both arms were moving made the patient feel like their phantom limb paralysis disappeared!</li><li name="21ed" id="21ed" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">For one person who was playing around with the mirror box, his phantom limb “disappeared” after a point. The theory is that because the brain saw visual feedback but no feedback from the actual muscles, it decided that it would ignore sensations from the phantom limb altogether because of this conflict.</li></ul><p name="e46e" id="e46e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li graf--trailing">There were also some experiments his team did where they could elicit sensations from inanimate objects by hijacking this visual and muscular feedback. For example, they placed the arm of a person under a table, and then stroked the surface of the table and the surface of the hidden arm in a synchronized manner. After a point, the person whose arm was being stroked would feel as if the sensation of stroking was coming from the table! And this is with their eyes open! That’s one hell of a party trick to try out.</p></div></div></section><section name="86ff" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="0639" id="0639" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing">Maybe when I finish the book I can spend some time to restructure this post so it isn’t just a bunch of bullet points. But I was so fascinated by what I just read that I had to get it out! Simply astounding.</p></div></div></section>
